              <p> Me and my brother like to bet. It’s not usuaully been with money, 
                normally just pushups, a dead leg, or pride. Nothing is outside 
                the realm of betting about. In order for it to work, the other 
                person has to hold up their end of the deal, and be honest. 
                Let’s just say my brother doesn’t exactly fit that description. That’s
                why the latest “I bet you can’t” right before I did really 
                stung. He owed me 5 bucks. But of course, he suddenly 
                didn’t remember and denied ever saying it. “We didn’t shake on 
                it!” -_-. That’s when I started thinking about what I could make 
                that would eliminate all doubts. It got me thinking about making 
                a website just for bets, but an entreprenuerial switch flipped on 
                and I decided that was too niche of a market. So I made the 
                decision to go along with online polls, and try to make a
                platform that has simple functionality. Along the way I’ve picked 
                up some great ideas, and here we are today!</p>
              <p> Midzy is the best platform on the web for finding out what 
                lots of people think. We do this through our fully capable polling 
                methods and user-friendly website. </p>
